The <a href="http://www.ibamonitoring.org/">IbaMonitoring.org</a> website was originally built in 2010, in support of the Mississippi River Twin Cities Important Bird Area Landbird Monitoring Program. This was a research program that ran from 2007 through 2011 at The University of Minnesota. The website was developed under a grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the source code was originally made available, under the Apache license, on CodePlex.

<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>
At this time, the tool is no longer being used for point count research. The source code has been resurrected as a test bed for proof of concept experimentation, with no definite aim other than learning and documenting the process.

The first fruit of that labor is a presentation on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/StephenFuqua/refactoring-web-forms-for-test-automation">Refactoring Legacy Web Forms for Test Automation</a>.
