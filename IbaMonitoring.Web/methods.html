    <h3>
        Pre-Survey Preparation</h3>
    <p>
        Re-familiarize yourself with birds that commonly migrate through and breed along
        the Twin Cities area of the Mississippi River. Practice estimating 50-meter distances
        for the fixed radius point counts.</p>
    <h4>
        Scouting</h4>
    <p>
        In most cases, survey points in each site have been visited to verify their location
        and accessibility and their GPS coordinates recorded. However, it is recommended
        that each surveyor/team visit their site before data collection begins to find parking,
        locate each point, and identify an optimal route around the site that minimizes
        travel time.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Site Access</h4>
    <p>
        In the event that a point becomes inaccessible, please re-locate a new point as
        close as possible to the original point. Note the new location on the site map and
        record the point ID number, GPS coordinates, and any other details about the new
        location on the map and data sheets.</p>
    <h4>
        Equipment Checklist</h4>
    <p>
        Equipment to be provided by Audubon:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Site maps with points marked</li>
        <li>Datasheets</li>
        <li>Clipboard</li>
        <li>GPS unit (you can either use your own or borrow one from Audubon)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Equipment to be provided by volunteers:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Binoculars</li>
        <li>Pencils or fine-point Sharpie® marker (won’t bleed in the rain)</li>
        <li>Watch or timer</li>

        <li>Water, sunscreen, snacks, etc.</li>
        <li>If desired, a buddy, fellow birder, or helpful hand</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        When to Survey Sites</h3>
    <h4>
        Dates</h4>
    <p>
        Point counts will be performed 6 times (once per week) during migration (mid-April
        to the end of May) and at least 2 times (separated by at least 1 ½ weeks) during
        the breeding season (early June-early July).
    </p>
    <h4>
        Time of Day</h4>
    <p>
        Begin sampling at your first point as close to sunrise as possible (as early as
        30min before sunrise). Point counts should not continue beyond 4 hours after sunrise.
        If all points in the site cannot be completed in this time frame, finish the remaining
        points another morning and make note of this on the datasheet with a brief explanation
        (ex. &quot;Started raining before points A, B, and C were surveyed&quot;). It is
        important that each site’s surveys be completed within as short a time as possible,
        as data will be collected on a weekly basis during migration.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Weather</h4>
    <p>
        Occasional short rain showers or bouts of light drizzle are acceptable, but point
        counts should not be conducted in fog, steady rain or drizzle. Likewise, avoid counting
        in conditions where the wind exceeds 12-15 mph (enough breeze to raise dust and
        loose paper and move small tree branches).
    </p>
    <h3>
        Counting Birds</h3>
    <h4>
        Survey Route</h4>
    <p>
        In order to avoid a &quot;time of day&quot; effect, alternate starting points for
        the route. For example, if you are working through points on a loop, walk clockwise
        one day and counter-clockwise through the points the next visit.
    </p>
    <h4>
        50 meter Fixed-Radius Point Count Methodology (5 minute duration)</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to each point using a hand-held GPS unit (see Appendix B).</li>
        <li>While working in teams is encouraged, there should be only one primary observer
            per site. Having another team member recording the data (as dictated by the observer)
            is very helpful and can allow the observer to focus solely on identifying birds.</li>
        <li>Wait for about a minute before beginning the 5-minute count period. This allows
            the observer to catch their breath, get oriented, record site conditions, and prepare
            the data sheets. Try to identify landmarks that are 50 meters from you.</li>
        <li>What to Count?
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Count all land birds seen or heard during a 5-minute period. Do not count waterfowl,
                    wading birds, or other water/shore birds </li>
                <li>Count all birds that flushed from the habitat upon the observer’s approach to the
                    point. </li>
                <li>Count birds that enter (and remain in) the habitat during the 5-minute period.</li>
                <li>Do not count flyovers (birds merely passing through). </li>
                <li>Count birds that are foraging aerially (flycatchers, etc.) </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>On the datasheet, identify birds using their 4 letter AOU Alpha Codes. If unsure
            of the identity of a bird, make notes on back of the data sheet with comments describing
            its song, appearance, and where you saw it—it is ok to go back and verify a suspected
            ID later if you feel confident you can. If you can partially identify the bird,
            identify it as specifically as you can. (ex. &quot;unknown sparrow&quot;). Otherwise,
            note it as UNKN.</li>
        <li>Denote birds seen or heard within 50 meters and those heard outside the 50-meter
            band. Record these distances as the horizontal distance from the observer to the
            bird.</li>
        <li>Don’t use any method of attracting or coaxing birds into view (i.e. no &quot;pishing&quot;).</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
        Temporary Noise or Interruptions</h4>
    <p>
        If a temporary noise (airplane overhead) or interruption (curious park patron) disrupts
        your count at a given point, pause the clock until the interruption has passed and
        then resume counting for the remainder of the period. The total count time for birds
        at every point (not including interruptions) should be 5 minutes.</p>
    <h3>
        Filling Out the Data Form</h3>
    <p>
        Complete a new data sheet for each visit to the site. On particularly busy mornings,
        more than one sheet may be needed. If no birds are observed at a given point, fill
        out the point information and note &quot;No Birds Observed&quot; on the data sheet.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Field Descriptions on Forms</h4>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Site</strong>: Name of the park or area being surveyed</li>
        <li><strong>Date</strong>: Use mm/dd/yyyy format</li>
        <li><strong>Site Start Time</strong>: Start time of first point count on the site. Use
            hh:mm format.</li>
        <li><strong>Site Stop Time</strong>: End time of last point count on the site. Use hh:mm
            format. </li>
        <li><strong>Temperature</strong>: Record the temperature in degrees (either Fahrenheit
            or Celsius) for the time at which the first point count was started and again at
            the end of the day’s survey. &nbsp;You may need to fill these out after the day’s
            surveying using <a href="http://www.weather.gov">www.weather.gov</a> or another
            weather forecasting site.</li>
        <li>For<strong> Sky</strong> and <strong>Wind</strong> entries, use the condition descriptions
            to assign codes to the site at the start of the first point count and end of the
            last count. If conditions differ substantially at subsequent points, make note of
            this in the Comments column of the data sheet. </li>
        <li><strong>Observer</strong>: Person actually searching for and identifying birds</li>
        <li><strong>Recorder</strong>: May be same as observer or another team member</li>
        <li><strong>Point ID</strong>: The full letter and number code for the sampling point</li>
        <li><strong>Noise Code</strong>: Use the Background Noise descriptions to assign a noise
            rating to each point prior to the point count</li>
        <li><strong>Time</strong>: Record the start time for each point count</li>
        <li><strong>Species Code</strong>: Use the 4 letter AOU Alpha Code for the species seen.
            If you are unsure of the correct code while in the field, write down an abbreviation
            you will recognise and enter the correct Alpha code later in the Comments section</li>
        <li><strong>Tally</strong>: Use this space to tally up the number of birds seen during
            5 min count</li>
        <li><strong>Total</strong>: Verify the tally using a numeral</li>
        <li><strong>Comments</strong>: Any observations of note for birds, sample point conditions,
            or interruptions</li>
    </ul>
